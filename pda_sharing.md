PDA sharing refers to the same PDA being shared with multiple user accounts. Sharing pda with multiple users can allow attackers to access/steal data and funds.

In the following code in WithdrawTokens account pool has constraint checking it should always have vault and withdraw destination.
The withdraw function here is creating seeds with the pool account. As multiple users can access the pool any malicious attacker can pass any user's account for withdrawal and his account as withdraw destination stealing all the funds. 
```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_insecure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[ctx.accounts.pool.mint.as_ref(), &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump]];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```

To secure the account and mitigate the issue we can change the code seed to specific account constraint. 
In the following code as you can see that the pool account has been changed to withdraw destination specific account.
Now if you think about malicious user passing other user's data and trying to withdraw tokens it'll require him to sign the transaction which is not possible as account is not owned by him.
```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_secure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```
Another way to make program more secure is to use anchor's seeds and bump constraints.
In the below example the constraint has been applied to the pool account where it is ensuring that the seeds of the withdraw destination matches that of while withdrawing the tokens. 
```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_recommended {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(
				has_one = vault,
				has_one = withdraw_destination,
				seeds = [withdraw_destination.key().as_ref()],
				bump = pool.bump,
		)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```
