Missing Rent Exemptions check:

In Solana, any account that has deposited more than 2 years worth of rent is considered rent-exempt. When an account is rent-exempt, it means that no rent is ever taken, which means that it can run indefinitely. Program executable accounts are required by the runtime to be rent-exempt to avoid being purged

However, there is a potential vulnerability in Solana smart contracts related to missing rent exemptions checks. Developers need to ensure that account owners and account states are validated before deploying the programs to the Solana main chain

If a developer misses this validation, a malicious user could potentially pass in accounts which are owned by a malicious program. This could lead to loss of funds if not properly checked

To avoid this vulnerability, it is crucial to validate the owners of the input accounts and ensure they are the expected owners. Here is an example

```rust
/// Check system program address
fn check_system_program(program_id: &Pubkey) -> Result<(), ProgramError> {
    if *program_id != system_program::id() {
        msg!(
            "Expected system program {}, received {}",
            system_program::id(),
            program_id
        );
        Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId)
    } else {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
Here the function checks if a program is a system program. If not, it returns an error, preventing any further action.
